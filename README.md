# Exchange Rate

> This project is under the [GPLv2 License](LICENSE)

This library is built to provide a way to get the latest exchange rates 
for various currencies given a base. Since the implementation is fairly simple, 
we aim to provide various language ports to provide similar functionality towards eachother. 


Current Language Implementations: 

- [C++](C++/README.md)
- [Rust](Rust/README.md)
